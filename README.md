# StarVis
This repository is for a data visualization project studying a database of 120,000 stars. I use the [HYG 3.0](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HSYwR0N8DmJ10MELgu2ruB4kY-72MZbP/view?usp=sharing) dataset, which can be read more about [here](http://www.astronexus.com/hyg).

## Time log:
### 2/8
25mins - exploratory analysis on color vs brightness

10mins - exploratory analysis on ra vs dec

20mins - trying to come up with function for projecting celestial sphere to a plane

40mins - refining visualization of northern sky

### 2/9
80mins - figuring out how to determine the alpha for each star given its magnitude

### 2/15
35mins - figuring out plots for distance vs velocity away from sun

	- then learned that within local group, expansion of universe is not measurable ;_;

### 2/16
20mins - looking into spectra, stellar temperatures

### 2/17
10mins - investigate magnitude vs distance

15mins - explore distribution of brightness, distance
