# StarVis
This repository is for a data visualization project studying a database of 120,000 stars. I use the [HYG 3.0](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HSYwR0N8DmJ10MELgu2ruB4kY-72MZbP/view?usp=sharing) dataset, which can be read more about [here](http://www.astronexus.com/hyg).

## Time log:
### 2/8
25mins - exploratory analysis on color vs brightness
10mins - exploratory analysis on ra vs dec
20mins - trying to come up with function for projecting celestial sphere to a plane
40mins - refining visualization of northern sky

### 2/9
80mins - figuring out how to determine the alpha for each star given its magnitude
